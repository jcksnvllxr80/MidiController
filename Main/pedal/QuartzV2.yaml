The Quartz can receive Midi messages from another Midi Controller, and do something with it. What it can do
is defined below. The messages that it listens to can all be changed. Normally pedal makers set this in stone,
but there are some Midi Controllers that only send certain messages, so now you can make the Quartz to suit them.
You can also change these messages to "Note On" messages for example. So that you can set a key on your
keyboard to be "next preset" for example. Or you could tell the Quartz to listen to PC messages, so that whenever you
change presets on another pedal, the Quartz will tap in a tempo. Just in case you ever want to see how fast
you change presets...
Since the messages can be changed, we won't list the value. Any Midi message will work to activate the following:
INCOMING MIDI
Set the tempo directly with a value. This requires 2 messages to be sent together. The 1st message's value is the 100's,
the 2nd message's value is the 10's and 1's or the BPM. If you send these messages for example:
Send...
Type = Control, Channel = 3, Message = 94, Value = 001
Then straight after send...
Type = Control, Channel = 3, Message = 94, Value = 059
Tempo will be set to 159 BPM (assuming that the Channel and Message value match).

Whenever this message is received, the Quartz will change to the next preset in the Setlist.
Whenever this message is received, the Quartz will change to the previous preset in the Setlist.
Set the Preset directly with the Value of the message.
If the Value of the message is 0, Global Tempo will be disabled.
If the Value of the message is 127, Global Tempo will be enabled.
The division for Output 1 will be set.
If the Value of the message = 0, Division = Quarter
If the Value of the message = 1, Division = 1/4 Triplets
If the Value of the message = 2, Division = Dotted 1/4
...and so on...
The division for Output 2 will be set.
If the Value of the message = 0, Division = Quarter
If the Value of the message = 1, Division = 1/4 Triplets
If the Value of the message = 2, Division = Dotted 1/4
...and so on...
The division for Output 3 will be set.
If the Value of the message = 0, Division = Quarter
If the Value of the message = 1, Division = 1/4 Triplets
If the Value of the message = 2, Division = Dotted 1/4
...and so on...
The division for Output 3 will be set.
If the Value of the message = 0, Division = Quarter
If the Value of the message = 1, Division = 1/4 Triplets
If the Value of the message = 2, Division = Dotted 1/4
...and so on...
The division for the Midi Clock will be set.
If the Value of the message = 0, Division = Quarter
If the Value of the message = 1, Division = 1/4 Triplets
If the Value of the message = 2, Division = Dotted 1/4
...and so on...

Send out a Midi Stack directly with the Value of the message.

If the Value of the message is 0, the Repeating Midi Stack will stop sending
If the Value of the message is 127, the Repeating Midi Stack will start sending

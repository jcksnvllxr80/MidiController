MIDI RECEIVE
The Super Switcher can be controlled by other MIDI devices. See SETUP MENU. Global values for MIDI receive channel, MIDI thru and MIDI clock ON/OFF are available in SETUP.
The tables on the following page list the Program Change (PC) and Control Change (CC) messages that the Super Switcher responds to on its MIDI IN connector.
PC Messages: Use PC messages to directly load presets through MIDI. For example, if you want directly load preset 03.1, send PC 16.
CC Messages: Use CC messages to directly perform button pushes through MIDI. CC Values 0-63 send an “off” message, 64-127 send “on”. We recommend interleaving on and off messages for the same button push.
